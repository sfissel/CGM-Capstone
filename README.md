# Continuous Glucose Monitoring Capstone Project


## Abstract
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management heavily relies on continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels using Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM). However, data gaps in CGM readings pose challenges in diabetes research and care. This study explores various imputation methods to address missing CGM data,  focusing on gaps with 4 or more consecutive missing blood glucose readings (CMBGR). Leveraging datasets from the Jaeb Center for Health Research, which include over 78 million glucose readings from 1,826 T1D patients, we compare the efficacy of several imputation techniques, including linear interpolation, cubic spline interpolation, Stineman interpolation, Kalman smoothing, and a sequence-to-sequence model using bidirectional LSTMs. Our evaluation criterion, based on root mean square error (RMSE) metrics, assesses these methods against the established standard of linear interpolation for up to 3 CMBGR. Our findings indicate that Kalman smoothing provides the most reliable imputation for up to 4 CMBGR with minimal increase in imputation error, suggesting it is possibly a viable method to enhance data completeness for T1D research and patient care.
